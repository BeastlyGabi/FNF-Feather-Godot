<img src=".github-readme/logo.png" height="150" />

-------------------------------

### a Godot Remaster of [Friday Night Funkin'](https://github.com/FunkinCrew/Funkin) 
made by ninjamuffin99, phantomarcade, evilsk8r, and kawaisprite

-------------------------------

Feather can be more labeled as a "for fun" project as its not really ready nor it will be ready (at least not *this* early) for use in modding, there's many areas on the source codebase that are very rough and hard to understand, and others are just a bit too overcomplicated, so keep in mind, **this project is not ready, and its still VERY much in its infancy**

# Features

- New Options such as Ghost Tapping, Custom Scroll Speeds, Timing Presets, Note Splashes, Combo Stacking, and more!

- Custom Credits Menu

-------------------------------

# Planned Features

- Revamped Base Game Menus (to an extent, I kinda wanna keep their original intended design while giving my own unique spin to them)
- Chart Editor for creating and editing charts
- Dialogue and Video Cutscenes
- a Mods Menu that works with ZIP files and Godot's PCK files!
