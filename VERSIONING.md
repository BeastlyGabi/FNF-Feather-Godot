# VERSIONING

-------------

Feather follows a versioning scheme similar to the schematic versioning scheme

you have a major version, a minor one, and a patch

in Feather, those numbers are formatted as

"MAJOR.MINORPATCH" and assigned a **Special Codename**

--------------

## Codenames

**Codename Iris**, from Greek, "Rainbow", means your current version is a **Stable Version**

Stable Versions are very self explanatory on their own.

**Codename Luna**, from Spanish, "Moon", means your current version is a **Beta Version**

Beta Versions are usually when new features were successfully tested and are now on a bug fixing phase, which at any case, help is heavily appreciated

**Codename Lilypad** means your current version is a in develpment version

in delevompent versions are the ones where new features get added or old features get reworked, this usually means the project isn't stable enough for public use, and it's more suited for those who want to see how the project is going

help with in development versions is appreciated, as the more faster a feature is finished, the more likely a beta version can be released, and the more likely a stable version can be released!
